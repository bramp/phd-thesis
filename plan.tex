\label{chap:plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Streaming is popular on the internet
        \item Streaming is bandwidth and latency intense
        \item CDNs/Streaming Protocols are used to allow for best streaming performance
        \item These assume start-to-finish model

        \item Users want more than start-to-finish
        \item VCR style controls are used
        \item More novel interactivity controls such as bookmarks could also be used
        \item Current CDNs/Streaming protocols are not optimised for these interactive workloads
    \end{itemize}

    \item Background

    \begin{itemize}%
        \item Previous characterisations of Access Patterns
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Video-on-Demand
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Popularity
                \item Popularity Over Time / Recommendations
                \item Session duration
                \item Interactivity
                \item Popularity Within Content
            \end{itemize}
            \item Live Streaming
            \begin{itemize}
    				\item Popularity
    				\item Time-of-day
    				\item Session duration
    				\item Interactivity
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}

        \item Discussion on Interactivity and how it breaks streaming
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Introduction
            \item Push/Pull Techniques~\footnote{incorporating Andy's Hybrid work.}\saveFN\andy\
            \item Hybrid concepts~\useFN\andy\
        \end{itemize}

        \item Papers about VoD systems, such as YouTube, and M\$'s
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Overview
            \item Describe what's typical on these services
            \item Describe what problems they have
        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

    \item Experiment
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User Study setup
        \item Tools developed (P2P Simulator, FLVTool++)
    \end{itemize}

    \item Evaluation (and modelling)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interactions
        \item Seek Distance
        \item Popularity
        \item Longevity
        \item Session Lengths
        \item Inter-seek Times
        \item Sequence
        \item Hotspot Length
    \end{itemize}

    \item Approaches to improve interactivity
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bookmark Creation and Moving Bookmarks
        \item Hotspot detection
        \item Predictive pre-fetching
        \item Techniques to support these in a distributed way~\footnote{80\% done}
        \item Hybrid Streaming Techniques~\useFN\andy\
    \end{itemize}

    \item Conclusions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Thesis Contributions
        \item Future Work
        \item Summary
    \end{itemize}
    
%    \item Extras (not currently included)~\footnote{Needs starting}
%    \begin{itemize}
%            \item Distributed pre-fetching, how can my miss be your hit?
%            \item Repeat visits to the worldcup site
%
%            \item Check if my results are ``fetch-at-most-one'' or not?
%
%            \item Look at probability of two events happening next to each other. ie 2 forward jumps, or 2 pauses, or forward jump then backwards jump.
%
%            \item Look at ``spurts'' of interactivity requests. ie do they happen uniformly across the session, or mostly in one go.
%
%            \item Look at CDF of \# of interactive request per user
